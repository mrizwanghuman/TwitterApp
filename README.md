# TwitterApp

This application is built with visual studio 2017 community edition. I have created this application MVC. 
To connect with Twitter API I have used LinqToTwitter C# library (https://linqtotwitter.codeplex.com/).As stated on their website,
LINQ to Twitter is an open source 3rd party LINQ Provider for the Twitter micro-blogging service. It uses standard LINQ syntax for queries and includes method calls for changes via the Twitter API.
It's Apache License (https://linqtotwitter.codeplex.com/license).
As you start the project you will see the home page with Search by Username Tweets and Search Tweets buttons. Once you click either of them a form will appear with two inputs(both inputs are required and the second input will only accept numbers. appropriate error messages are implemented).
